# --- MANDATORY COMMAND EXECUTION PROTOCOL ---

## RULE 1: STRICTLY ONE ACTION PER COMMAND. NO CHAINING

You MUST execute each logical operation as a separate, single command. NEVER chain commands using `&&`, `;`, or pipes like `|`. I need to see the individual output and exit code for every step to diagnose failures.

- **FORBIDDEN:** `docker compose exec ... cmd1 && docker compose exec ... cmd2`
- **MANDATORY:**

  ```bash
  # Step 1: Run the first command
  docker compose exec ... cmd1

  # Step 2: After the first command completes, run the second
  docker compose exec ... cmd2
  ```
